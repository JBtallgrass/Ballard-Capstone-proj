## 🧑‍💼 Jason A. Ballard  

### Instructional Systems Specialist | Data Scientist | Data and AI Officer | Data Literacy Advocate | Educator in Professional Military Education

Welcome! I'm Jason A. Ballard, an experienced leader in data and AI integration, currently serving as the Data and AI Officer for the US Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. My work bridges data science, AI strategy, and higher education, focusing on transforming decision-making through data literacy and innovation.

I invite you to explore my GitHub repository, [jbtallgrass](https://github.com/JBtallgrass?tab=repositories), where I share insights, tools, and resources focused on data literacy and advanced analytics in educational contexts. My projects emphasize practical solutions, open collaboration, and a commitment to enhancing data accessibility across teams.

### 🔑 Key Areas of Focus

- **Data Strategy & Governance**: Developing frameworks that promote data-driven decision-making and cross-departmental data sharing.  
- **AI & Analytics**: Leveraging data analytics and GenAI to unlock insights and drive transformational initiatives within the Army University.  
- **Data Literacy & Education**: Equipping leaders and students with data literacy skills critical for today's complex, data-rich environments.

## **TL;DR:**

This project uses Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to predict mushroom toxicity using UCI’s Mushroom dataset. With carefully selected features (including an engineered interaction feature), the models achieved near-perfect accuracy. Full ML pipeline, visualizations, and reflections included.

## Project Overview

Organizations frequently need to classify data to support decision-making.
For example, a healthcare provider may want to predict whether a patient has a specific condition based on lab results,
or a business may classify customer behavior to tailor marketing strategies.
Machine learning classification models help automate these decisions by recognizing patterns in historical data.

This project demonstrates the ability to apply classification modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. You will:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Analyze feature distributions and consider feature selection.
- Train and evaluate a classification model.
- Compare different classification approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmate’s project. ![Peer Review](peer_review.md)
